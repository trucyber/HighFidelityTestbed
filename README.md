# HighFidelityTestbed (HFT)
High-Fidelity testbed for evaluation of ICS ecosystems

Due the rapid growth of cyber attacks to industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS), stakeholders are in desperate need of experimental testbeds that can provide a fexible, scalable, and interoperable platform for performing diverse cybersecurity experiments. In particular the HFT is designed to address the following research questions:

(1) Dynamically instantiate and evaluate performance of continuous authentication in a large scale ICPS environment.

(2) Develop automated plug-in capability to integrate hardware field sensors and program logic controllers to evaluate and compare performance of devised mechanisms.

The following documentation describes the two major components of the HFT.

(i) HLF folder introduces the components of a state-of-art distributed network that leverage the core compoenents of the distributed ledger software, namely, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). HLF integrates a modular architecture that enables consensus and membership services.

(ii) SCADA folder describes components of ICS

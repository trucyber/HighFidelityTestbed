# HighFidelityTestbed (HFT)
High-Fidelity testbed for evaluation of ICS ecosystems

Overall, modeling the stochastic nature of critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) requires resourceful devices to support complex operations. In general, minimum efforts to address the lack of robust high-fidelity experiment setups have been proposed among the research community. Stakeholders are in need of developing a scalable and flexible framework that can provide a high-fidelity experimental setup for analyzing and evaluating state-of-art security solutions that have the capabilities to address standard cyber attacks such as identity spoofing and false sequential attacks that, in general, exploit security vulnerabilities such as weak control access policies and lack of proper integrity verification. Distributed and modular platforms such as cluster management and Virtual Machine (VM) management are appealing in the ICS context because they enable highly modular platforms. Commonly, high modular platforms are needed to model complex systems processes with high fidelity. We provide a case study to analyze the performance of a High-Fidelity Testbed (HFT) for traditional ICS ecosystems. The proposed HFT enables scalable, heterogeneous, and flexible experimental setups. We leverage the HFT to analyze state-of-art security solutions that address standard security standards threats.
